Bug Reports

* Bug 1
    Appt.java, isValid() :Line 115
    if(startHour<0 && startHour>23) //changed || to &&

      This bug causes the startHour to be less than zero and more than 23
      at the same time which is impossible, as by replacing the || to && no
      mater what value its never going to be invalid. Thus, this causes a chain
      reaction in the application, causing other tests methods and functions
      to crash.

* Bug 2
  CalDay.java, setAppts() :Line 117
  if(appts!=null || appts.size()==0) //changed && to ||

    This bug causes the appointment to not be null or equal to size zero, by
    doing this causes the it set an appointment even when either of the
    condition are being fulfilled.As by replacing the && to || even if either of
    the condition is fulfilled it will set an appointment which will be invlalid
    Thus, this causes a chain reaction in the application, causing other tests
    methods and functions to crash.
